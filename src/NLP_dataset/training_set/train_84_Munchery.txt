About the Engineering Team
For our software engineers, code is a way of life. You're the kind of person who enjoys picking up a new language on your free time, and get the tingles thinking about scalable, high-performance systems. Our engineers play a critical part in designing the technology behind Munchery's e-commerce and operations management systems. Our code is very "tangible." It moves food from production to inventory to fulfillment and delivery, and a ton of algorithms behind it. With the lack of innovation in the "tech and taste" space, there's nothing better than putting smart, creative engineers to solve it.
